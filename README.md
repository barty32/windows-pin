# Windows Pin
This small utility can be used to pin any window to the top of screen (keep it always above all other windows).


# Usage
It's as simple as opening the window's system menu (by right-clicking the title bar or by pressing Alt+Spacebar) and selecting Pin to top.

If for some reason the above method does not work, there is an alternative: click on the Windows Pin's taskbar tray icon and then click in the window you want to pin.

# Installation
Just unpack downloaded archive and execute "Windows Pin.exe". Works on both x86 and x64 Windows systems with Windows 10, 8.x, 7, Vista and XP.
**Warning:** Your antivirus may remove some of the files, so before executing make sure the antivirus didn't delete them.
