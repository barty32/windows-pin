# Windows Pin
This small utility can be used to pin any window to the top of screen (keep it always above all other windows).

# Usage
It's as simple as opening the window's system menu (by right-clicking the title bar or by pressing Alt+Spacebar) and selecting Pin to top.

If for some reason the above method does not work, there is an alternative: click on the Windows Pin's taskbar tray icon and then click the window you want to pin.
